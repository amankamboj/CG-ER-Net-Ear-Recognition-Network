# CG-ER-Net-Ear-Reconition-Network
Ear reconition network for data scarce scenario. The framework consist of three steps. Ear Segentation, Ear Alignment and Finally Ear Recogntion.
Also the codes are provided to for the comaprison with state-of-the-art deep learning models VGG19, ResNet, Inception, Xception, MobileNet in which pre-trained weights are used suring training.

The code is yet partial. However, the complete code will be provided after the accptance notifaction of the paper.
