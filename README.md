# CG-ER-Net-Ear-Recognition-Network

Ear recognition network for scarce data scenario. The framework consists of three steps: 

1) Ear Segmentation, 2) Ear Alignment, and Finally, 3) Ear Recognition. 

Also, the codes are provided for the comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning models VGG19, ResNet, Inception, Xception, MobileNet in which pre-trained weights are used during training.

Currently we have provided partial codes. However, the complete code will be provided after the acceptance notification of the paper.
